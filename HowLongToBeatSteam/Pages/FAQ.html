        <h4>How does HowLongToBeatSteam work?</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam retrieves completion playtimes from <a href="http://www.howlongtobeat.com">HowLongToBeat</a>
            and applies them to your Steam library in order to get an aggregated view of how long it would take to complete all (included and unfiltered)
            finite single-player games in your account.
        </p>
        <h4>Give me the technical version</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam uses the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/dev">Steam Web API</a> for game metadata
            and user playtime. As for HowLongToBeat, unfortunately they have no API, so their HTML pages are parsed (scraped) directly.
        </p>
        <h4>Why are you asking for my password when I sign in through Steam? Are you trying to steal it?</h4>
        <p>
            When you sign-in through Steam, you are not actually supplying your credentials to HowLongToBeatSteam.
            Rather, you are signing in to Steam/Valve itself (look at the URL - it says <em>https://steamcommunity.com/..</em>).
            Steam then passes on a token to HowLongToBeatSteam that merely verifies you are who you say you are,
            and even that is only in terms of your profile ID (which is public anyway).
            Besides, you don't even need to supply your credentials - your public Steam profile ID works too.
            For more information on the login process, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07q4XgMgoPc">login tutorial</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>What makes HowLongToBeatSteam different from other sites that claim to do the same thing?</h4>
        <p>
            At the time of writing, no other site is even remotely as robust, accurate, up-to-date, feature-rich, and detailed as HowLongToBeatSteam.
            And it wasn't easy - it took over a year's worth of weekends to build (other sites were built in a few weekends at most).
            As a small example, consider how HowLongToBeat playtimes are retrieved.
            Since they have no official API from HowLongToBeat, their HTML pages must be parsed (scraped) directly.
            But that's easier said than done, seeing as how the statistics come in highly inconsistent formats -
            Sometimes they say "Main", sometimes "Solo". Sometimes they are specified in hours, sometimes in minutes.
            Sometimes all completion levels are reported, sometimes only some (or even none). And so on, and so forth.
            We can't speak for other sites (especially considering how quickly they were built),
            but this is the attention to detail you can expect from HowLongToBeatSteam.
            The only other site that attempted to dive into this level of detail eventually
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029091210/http://steamplaytime.appspot.com/?">closed down, realizing the amount of effort required</a>.
            Continue reading to learn more about some of the stuff we do to set us apart.
        </p>
        <h4>Why are some of my games excluded?</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam only considers games in your library that have finite single-player campaigns and haven't been removed from the Steam store.
            After all, multiplayer-only games cannot be "completed" so there would be little point in trying to measure them in this context.
            Similarly, single-player games with infinite campaigns that never clearly end
            (dubbed <a href="https://www.google.co.il/search?q=site:howlongtobeat.com+%22endless+title%22">endless titles</a> on HowLongToBeat)
            are excluded as well.
            Finally, games removed from the Steam store don't participate in the Steam API and so no metadata can be gathered on them.
        </p>
        <h4>Why do some of the apps in my Steam account that aren't actually games show up?</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam takes great care to filter out Steam apps that aren't single-player games, but the Steam API is not perfect and
            sometime incorrect game metadata is reported.
            If you spot such apps, please report them by clicking the <em>not a game?</em> link.
            They will be marked as such in the database and excluded from future calculations once your submission is approved.
            It is important to note that the opposite also happens some times, where single-player games aren't properly reported by the Steam API.
            We have an automatic job that scans for these cases and fixes them on a weekly basis.
        </p>
        <h4>Why does HowLongToBeatSteam match some of my games to incorrect HowLongToBeat entries?</h4>
        <p>
            The sad truth is that there is no central repository correlating Steam games to their corresponding HowLongToBeat entries
            (worse, some games/editions may not even exist on HowLongToBeat). We are therefore forced to rely on simple textual search to make the matches,
            which may fail even for games that do exist on HowLongToBeat due to different naming schemes and search quirks
            (for example Steam may have "GOTY" where HowLongToBeat has "Game of The Year Edition").
        </p>
        <h4>So are we forever doomed to rely on incorrect Steam/HoLongToBeat correlations?</h4>
        <p>
            Not at all! This is where the suggestion mechanism of the site comes into play - the power of <em>community</em> is on our side.
            Whenever you see a game that's not correlated correctly (or at all), simply find that game on HowLongToBeat (assuming it's there of course)
            and update the connection. Thousands of updates have already been submitted, reviewed, and applied.
        </p>
        <h4>What about games that aren't on HowLongToBeat at all? Or games with partial playtime stats?</h4>
        <p>
            Good question.
            This is where we harness the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)"><em>statistical imputation</em></a>.
            Basically it's an advanced statistical method for substituting missing samples with probable values,
            so that the total dataset closely resembles one where no values are missing. We even fix HowLongToBeat values that don't make sense
            (such as "Main" taking longer than "Completionist").
        </p>
        <h4>Why can't I flag some games as endless?</h4>
        <p>
            Some games have been manually verified to be finite with a single-player campaign ending in actual credits that roll when beaten.
        </p>
        <h4>How up-to-date is HowLongToBeatSteam?</h4>
        <p>
            New Steam games are updated every 1-2 hours. HowLongToBeat Playtime statistics for existing games are updated weekly.
            Suggestions are typically reviewed and accepted (or rejected, as the case may be) weekly.
        </p>
        <h4>How does the Steam Survival Calculator know when I'll die?</h4>
        <p>
            We have a weekly meeting with the Grim Reaper, and we know who you are! Just kidding, we use the following service:
            <a href="http://http://api.population.io/">http://api.population.io/</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>What if HowLongToBeat change their HTML format, breaking your scraping ? What if ...?</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam is fully tested, automated, and audited. All jobs are monitored and a full test suite runs every day.
            If anything goes wrong we will find out about it very quickly, identify the root cause (we have comprehensive traces and events),
            and fix it to make sure HowLongToBeatSteam is properly functioning.
        </p>
        <h4>What technologies were used to build HowLongToBeatSteam?</h4>
        <p>
            HowLongToBeatSteam was built on top of ASP.NET Web API and is hosted on Microsoft Azure (as a Web App).
            It utilizes the following server-side technologies: WebJobs, Table and Blob storage, AzureML (running R code),
            Application Insights, Enterprise Library (SLAB, TOPAZ), ETW, SendGrid, Zapier, and DotNetOpenAuth.
            The client-side was built on top of the following technologies: Knockout, JQuery, Sammy, Bootstrap, Google Analytics, Application Insights,
            Countdown.js, amCharts (including contributions to the responsive plugin), and knockout-datatable (including contributions to add and improve some features).
            The source code is hosted on Visual Studio Team Services (git) and was fully developed in Visual Studio. Check the GitHub link at the bottom right for the source.

        <h4>Why do you keep saying "we"? The footer suggests you are just one guy!</h4>
        <p>
            It's fun to start sentences with "we", try it!
