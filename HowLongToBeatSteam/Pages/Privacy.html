        For diagnostics and performance reasons only, we collect and store in server memory and logs the Steam Profile IDs for which
        completion time statistics were requested by users. It is the user's responsibility to make sure it does not contain and
        personally-identifiable information. Indeed, only public Steam profiles have use in this site, as Steam's API
        will block our requests otherwise.

        and return visits to the site.
