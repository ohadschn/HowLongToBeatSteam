        <h3>Data Collected on this Website</h3>
        <p>
            For diagnostics and performance reasons only, we collect and store in server memory and logs the Steam Profile IDs for which
            completion time statistics were requested by users. It is the user's responsibility to make sure it does not contain and
            personally-identifiable information. Indeed, only public Steam profiles have use in this site, as Steam's API
            will block our requests otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also use "Google Analytics" and "Microsoft Application Insights",
            services that record non-personally identifiable data such as browser type, operating system, the date and time of a visit,
            where visitors came from, the pages visited on this website, the time spent viewing site, where visitors went when they left the site,
            and return visits to the site.
        </p>

        <p>
            We aggregate this non-personally identifiable data to better understand how visitors use our site,
            and to help manage, maintain, and report on use of our website. We do not rent, sell or share any non-personally identifiable data collected
            on this website with third parties for marketing purposes.
